# Prusa-i3v-10-Restoration

This repo is a compilation of all the info I gathered on the Prusa i3v 10 3D printer. Everything here was used to restore the printer to a functional state. The machine itself is still not 100% finished but I no longer have physical access to it to work on it.

# Hardware Details

Arduino Mega 2560

RAMPS 1.4 Controller

Direct Drive Filament Feed

Heated Print Bed

Filament Diameter: 1.75mm (Speculated)
